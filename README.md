# Next Firebase Authentication

`Next Firebase Authentication` is a project that demonstrates how to implement user authentication in a Next.js application using `Firebase Authentication`. It provides a complete user authentication flow, including user `registration`, `login`, `password reset`, and `user account deletion`.

## Features

- **User registration and login**: Users can register and login with email and password.
- **Profile management**: Users can update their profile information, including name and photo URL.
- **Password change**: Users can change their password.
- **Firebase integration**: The application uses Firebase for authentication and data storage.
- **TypeScript**: The codebase is written in TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
- **Next.js**: A React framework for building JavaScript applications with server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **Firebase Authentication**: A service that provides backend services, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries to authenticate users to your app.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Getting Started
